# Categorical data, which represents groups or labels, is best visualized using plots that compare counts or proportions. Common techniques include:
# -->Bar Chart**: Displays the frequency or count of each category.
# -->Pie Chart**: Shows the proportion of each category within a whole. It's most effective for a small number of categories.
# -->Count Plot**: A specialized bar plot (often from Seaborn) that shows the counts of observations in each categorical bin.





### 2. What are the data visualization techniques used for numerical data?
# Numerical data, which represents measurable quantities, is best visualized using plots that show distribution, trends, and relationships. Common techniques include:
# -->Histogram**: Displays the frequency distribution of a single numerical variable.
# -->Box Plot**: Shows the distribution of a variable, including its quartiles, median, and potential outliers.
# -->Scatter Plot**: Illustrates the relationship or correlation between two numerical variables.
# -->Line Plot**: Best for visualizing trends over time or across an ordered sequence.





# ### 3. Difference between Matplotlib and Seaborn.
# Matplotlib** is a low-level, foundational plotting library in Python, while **Seaborn** is a higher-level library built on top of Matplotlib.
#  --->Matplotlib:- provides granular control over every aspect of a plot,
#       but it often requires more code to create complex or aesthetically pleasing visualizations. It's the "building blocks" of Python plotting.

#  --->Seaborn:- offers a more streamlined and intuitive interface for creating statistical graphics. 
# It comes with built-in themes and a rich set of functions specifically for visualizing statistical relationships, 
# making it faster to create attractive and informative plots. Essentially, Seaborn simplifies and enhances the process of plotting data,
# especially for common statistical charts.
